# Database for Academic Articles & Research Papers
A program that interacts with a database consisting of academic articles and research papers

- We implemented frontend and backend operations to develop a program serving students involved in academic research
- We composed a MySQL relational database consisting of articles and research papers published by universities
- We used the Eclipse IDE and the Java Swing library for GUI to code an API authorizing users to create, read, update, and delete items in the database

An outline of our relational database is shown in 'Database for Academic Articles.pdf'

Note: specific instructions on how to configure and run the program are included in a separate README.txt file in the frontend folder
